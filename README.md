# Student-List

This is a simple application using JavaFX and a local MySQL Database.

## Implemented features

The application is capable of :

- Retrieving a list of students from a database and displaying them. 

- Displaying the details of a student when his name is selected.

- Editing the information of an existing student.

- Adding a new student by adding part of the information.

- Deleting a student.

- Displaying the average grade of the students in the list.

- Validating data entry and displaying error messages accordingly.

## Non-implemented features

- Images have been working weirdly for me, with some students being able to display any image, while differents students trying to display the same picture with the same path can not.
